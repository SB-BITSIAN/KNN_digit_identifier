"# KNN_digit_identifier" 
The program makes use of K-nearest neighbours algorithm to detect the handwritten digits. The program has been tested for 1000 sample test cases for which an accuracy of 97.7% was registered. The same can be extended to remaining 7400 cases to check for the accuracy of the overall program. The dataset used for the analysis is appended alongside.
The program is quite slow as the complexity is of the order of O(m*n).
